# Geometry Figures Calculator

This is a simple DOM-based project name geometry-genius that allows users to calculate various properties of different geometry figures. Users can input specific values for each figure, perform calculations, and view the results in a table. Additionally, the results can be converted from centimeters (cm) to meters (m) with a simple button click.

## Features

1. Interactive Geometry Figures: Each figure has dedicated input fields where users can provide dimensions.
2. Calculation Button: After entering values, users can click the "Calculate" button to perform calculations, such as area or perimeter, depending on the figure.
3. Result Table: The results are displayed in a table showing the figure name and the calculated value in centimeters (cm).
4. Conversion Feature: A conversion button is available for each result to convert the value from centimeters to meters.

## How It Works

1. Input Values: For each geometry figure (such as a square, circle, triangle, etc.), input fields are available to enter the necessary dimensions (e.g., radius, length, width, etc.).
2. Calculate: After providing the inputs, click the "Calculate" button. The calculation result (such as area or perimeter) will be displayed in the results table in centimeters (cm).
3. Conversion to Meters: Each result in the table has a conversion button. Clicking this button will convert the value from centimeters to meters (m) and update the table.

## Technology Used

1. HTML: Structure of the page and layout for geometry figures, input fields, and the results table.
2. CSS: Basic styling for the layout and appearance of the figures, buttons, and table.
3. JavaScript (DOM Manipulation): Handles the interaction, calculation logic, and conversion between centimeters and meters.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone or download the project to your local machine.
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
3. You should see several geometry figures with input fields, a calculate button, and a results table.
4. Provide values in the input fields, click "Calculate," and see the results in the table.
5. Use the "Convert to Meters" button to switch between centimeters and meters.
